madlibs
=======

## Execution

To execute, run `./madlibs` in the install directory. This will display the proper usage for the script.

Running `./madlibs [file]` (where file is a valid filename without the extension) will output the story

## Adding Stories

Stories are added in the `stories` folder in the main directory.

Make sure that the files are named with a `.txt` extension, otherwise the file retrieval will not work.

Additionally, an empty line must be present at the end of the file, otherwise the story will be missing the last line of text.
